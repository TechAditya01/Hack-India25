# SmartForge.ai Landing Page

A static landing page for a smart contract AI platform using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Overview

SmartForge.ai is a web application that showcases a platform for AI-powered smart contract generation, deployment, and acceleration. This landing page serves as a static preview of the platform's functionality with a clean, modern interface.

## Features

- **Dark theme** with green accent colors for a modern tech aesthetic
- **Interactive chat interface** with simulated AI responses
- **Responsive design** that works well on desktop and mobile devices
- **Form validation** for the email subscription feature
- **Wallet connection UI** (simulated for demonstration purposes)

```

## Getting Started

1. Download or clone this repository
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser
3. No build steps or server required - this is a static site

## Future Development

The project includes commented code for future AI model integration using the OpenAI API. To implement this:

1. Uncomment the `sendMessageWithAI` function in `assets/main.js`
2. Replace the current `sendMessage` function calls with `sendMessageWithAI`
3. Add your API key through environment variables
4. Implement server-side code to securely handle API requests
